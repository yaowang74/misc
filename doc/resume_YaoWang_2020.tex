		{\vspace{3pt}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Performed data ETL and modeling jobs on bodily injury(BI) claims/medical data for 7-Eleven with SAS EG
				\item Built two sequential ordered BI severity models for different moments in the life of a claim(at first contact and at 6-month evaluation point) respectively to classify if total incured cost of a claim beyond ten thousands dollar 
				\item Compared to subjective classification used in practice, new models leads to significant improvements in the prediction of BI severity level and therefore greately improved insurer's reserves for those claims
				%\item Many companies estimate (and therefore reserve) bodily injury compensation directly from initial medical reports. This practice may underestimate the final cost, because the severity is often assessed during the recovery period. Since the evaluation of this severity is often only qualitative, in this paper we apply an ordered multiple choice model at different moments in the life of a claim reported to an insurance company. We assume that the information available to the insurer does not flow continuously, because it is obtained at different stages. Using a real data set, we show that the application of sequential ordered logit models leads to a significant improvement in the prediction of the BI severity level, compared to the subjective classification that is used in practice. We also show that these results could improve the insurer’s reserves notably.
				\item Created SAS macros to monitor key metircs distribution between input scoring data and training data, tracking outputs from production and development environment and measuring production model performance 
				\item  Loaded and transformed raw survey data with R to conduct professional network analysis
