			\item Created $\sim$100 numerical, categorical and \textbf{text mining} variables, built {decision tree} severity model for at first contact and {logistic regression} model at 6-month evaluation point using \textbf{SAS EG} %Compared to subjective classification that is used in practice, new models leads to significant improvements in the prediction of severity level and insurer's reserves 
			%\item Many companies estimate (and therefore reserve) bodily injury compensation directly from initial medical reports. This practice may underestimate the final cost, because the severity is often assessed during the recovery period. Since the evaluation of this severity is often only qualitative, in this paper we apply an ordered multiple choice model at different moments in the life of a claim reported to an insurance company. We assume that the information available to the insurer does not flow continuously, because it is obtained at different stages. Using a real data set, we show that the application of sequential ordered logit models leads to a significant improvement in the prediction of the BI severity level, compared to the subjective classification that is used in practice. We also show that these results could improve the insurerâ€™s reserves notably.
