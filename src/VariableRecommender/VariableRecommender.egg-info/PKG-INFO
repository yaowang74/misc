Description: Variable Recommenderis a package on feature selection.
        
        Feature selection is a process where you automatically select those features in
        your data that contribute most to the prediction variable or output in which
        you are interested.
        
        Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of many
        models, especially linear algorithms like linear and logistic regression.
        
        Three main benefits of performing feature selection before modeling are:
            * Reduces Overfitting: Less redundant data means less chance to make
                                   decision based on noicse.
            * Improves Accuracy: Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves
            * Reduces Training Time: Less data means that algorithms train faster
